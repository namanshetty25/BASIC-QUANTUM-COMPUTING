This repository contains a quantum circuit simulation using PennyLane and Matplotlib. The circuit applies a series of quantum gates to 3 qubits and visualizes the probability distribution of the output states.
The Bloch_sphere project visualizes a quantum state on the Bloch sphere using the QuTiP library, providing a geometric representation of a qubit's state. By specifying spherical coordinates θ and 𝜙, the code calculates the Cartesian coordinates of the quantum state and adds it to the Bloch sphere for visualization. Running the script renders the Bloch sphere, displaying the corresponding state vector in a 3D plot.
Simple_quantum_circuit demonstrates the use of various quantum gates using the PennyLane library in a 3-qubit quantum circuit. It applies Pauli-X and Hadamard gates, as well as a CNOT gate, to illustrate how these operations affect the qubit states. The final state and its probabilities are visualized using a bar chart to represent the resulting quantum state.
Grover's algorithm is designed to search for the target state |11> from a set of possible states |00>,|01>,|10> and |11>. By amplifying the probability of the target state, the algorithm increases the likelihood of measuring |11> compared to the other states.
